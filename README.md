# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains data about passengers who were aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic. The dataset includes information such as the passengers' survival status, class, age, sex, fare, and other features.

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answer various questions about the passengers based on the dataset. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that could help in understanding passenger survival rates and other related factors.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset consists of the following key features:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male/female)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset using SQL queries and produce meaningful insights regarding the passengers, such as:

1. **Survival Rates**: Analyzing the number of survivors, the survival rate by class, gender, age group, etc.
2. **Average Fare**: Investigating the average fare paid by passengers in different classes.
3. **Passenger Demographics**: Identifying the oldest and youngest survivors, and determining how many male and female passengers survived.
4. **Class Distribution**: Exploring the distribution of passengers across different classes and their survival rates.
5. **Correlations**: Uncovering relationships between different passenger attributes (e.g., age, sex, class) and survival rates.

## Key Questions Explored

- How many passengers survived the Titanic disaster?
- What is the average age of passengers who survived and those who did not?
- How many passengers were in each class, and how does survival vary by class?
- Which passenger paid the highest fare, and what was their survival status?
- Who was the oldest passenger to survive the Titanic disaster?
- What is the relationship between gender and survival?
- How many male and female passengers survived?

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Used for querying the Titanic dataset to extract relevant information.
- **SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Database management systems (DBMS) used to store and query the Titanic dataset.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and project collaboration platform.

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Exploration**: Querying the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Data Analysis**: Writing and running SQL queries to answer key questions about the dataset.
3. **Visualization (Optional)**: While not implemented in this project, data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) can be used to visualize the analysis results.
4. **Documentation**: Creating this README file to document the analysis and findings.

## Insights & Findings

Some of the key insights from the analysis (based on the SQL queries executed) include:

- The number of passengers who survived the Titanic disaster and their distribution across classes and genders.
- The average fare paid by passengers in each class and how it varies.
- The oldest and youngest survivors, including the oldest survivor who paid the highest fare.
- A breakdown of male and female survival rates, and how factors such as age and class affected survival chances.

## Future Work

- **Advanced Analysis**: Further analysis could include predicting survival rates using machine learning techniques like logistic regression or decision trees.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the relationships between various features (e.g., survival vs. class, gender, age) to provide more intuitive insights.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, outliers, or other potential issues in the dataset to improve the accuracy of analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-dataset-analysis.git
    ```
2. Import the Titanic dataset into your SQL database (SQLite, MySQL, etc.).
3. Run the SQL queries provided in this repository to explore and analyze the dataset.
4. For visualization or further analysis, additional tools or scripts can be implemented as needed.
